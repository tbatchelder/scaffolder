# Scaffolder

Scaffolder is a creative ops and project definition tool that helps you build the structural, aesthetic, and functional scaffolding your AI agents need to execute complex projects.

Before you build, you scaffold.

## License Explained in Plain English

Scaffolder is released under the MIT License with the Commons Clause. Here’s what that means in simple terms: ✔ You can: • Use Scaffolder for personal projects • Use Scaffolder inside your company • Fork the repo • Modify the code • Submit pull requests • Build add ons, templates, or extensions • Learn from the code • Experiment, explore, and play ❌ You cannot: • Sell Scaffolder • Sell a product that includes Scaffolder • Sell a service whose value comes mainly from Scaffolder • Rebrand Scaffolder and offer it as your own competing product • Host Scaffolder as a paid SaaS • Create a commercial derivative of Scaffolder

## Why Commons Clause?

Scaffolder is designed to be a shared resource — a place where developers, designers, and AI builders can collaborate on better agentic workflows and project scaffolding techniques. The Commons Clause helps us strike the right balance between openness and protection:

1. It keeps Scaffolder open and accessible Anyone can use it, fork it, and contribute to it. Companies can use it internally. Students, hobbyists, and indie devs can build with it freely.
2. It prevents commercial clones The Commons Clause stops someone from: • taking Scaffolder • renaming it • adding a logo • and selling it as their own competing product This protects the identity, vision, and long term sustainability of the project.
3. It supports a hybrid free + paid model Scaffolder will always have a free, open core. But future paid tiers, hosted versions, or advanced features need to remain under the project’s control. The Commons Clause ensures that the project can grow sustainably without being undercut by copycats.
4. It keeps the community contributions meaningful When people contribute to Scaffolder, they know their work won’t be used to power someone else’s commercial clone. Their contributions stay part of the shared commons — not someone else’s business.
